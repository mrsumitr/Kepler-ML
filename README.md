# Kepler-ML
This is a project of studying data given of exo-planet to predict that whether it is exo-planet or not.
First, I have performed EDA on it.
Later, Feature engineering.
We have trained this data on four different model.
logistic regression 
SVM
random forest
naive bayes
later, I have saved the trained model.
